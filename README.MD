# Challenge | Frontend Developer

## Comments

First of all, i want say that it was very amazing make this web application with Javascript Vanilla. 
I thinked about abstractions and implementation in a very encapsulated way and consequently make reusable layers as much as I could.


I had some unforeseen events who were delayed by two days delivering the challenge, sorry for this, i make some freelancers works and my customer needed of some changes in his website, what ended up taking up part of my time.
